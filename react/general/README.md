This app contains following contents:

- `Cancel fetching` when moving other pages (works only with `Link` tag, use `Network`: `Slow 3G` to test)
  - Subscription
  - AbortController
- `Specific dependencies` to prevent re-rendering when to get duplicated value (works only with useState that contains an Object)
